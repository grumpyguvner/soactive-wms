	<h1>activeWMS Browser Requirements</h1>

	<ul>

		<li>
			<h3>Enabled JavaScript v2.0 or higher processing</h3>
			<p>
				activeWMS heavily uses JavaScript, including newer functions only found in version 2.0 or higher.
				Most newer browsers support this, but make sure that JavaScript is enabled for this web application
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<h3>Allow window pop-ups</h3>
			<p>
				This application sparingly uses JavaScript to open multiple windows when printing.  If your browser
				or third-party browser plug in prohibits pop-ups from this application, printing reports will not
				be displayed.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<h3>Cookie support</h3>
			<p>
				activeWMS sets a single cookie to track your login.  Cookie support for this site
				must be enabled in order for the application to allow you to log in
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<h3>Full Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) v1.2 support</h3>
			<p>
				activeWMS takes advantage of CSS v1.2 to render pages.  Without this
				support, the application may not look correct, and can even break some
				functionality.
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
