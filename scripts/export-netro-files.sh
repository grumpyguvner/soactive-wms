# Script to export files to Netro
#
# This module assumes that the files have been copied to the local folder
#  /home/activewms/data_transfers/netro_input - contains the files exported from the database
#
# This script ensures that all 12 files it expects are in the above folder, if not
#  it does not continue, this is so that we do not begin an upload before the
#  previous process has completed.
#
# If all files (see below) are present then it uploads them to the ftp server using
#  wput and removes them if the transfer was successful (a feature of wput).
#
# The complete list of files that this script looks for is:
#  ALSTYLES.CSV
#  BRIGHTON.CSV
#  CGARDEN.CSV
#  COLOUR.CSV
#  DEPTS.CSV
#  GROUPS.CSV
#  PRODUCTS.CSV
#  SIZE.CSV
#  STYLES.CSV
#  supplier.CSV
#  WEBSTORE.CSV
#  WHSE.CSV
#

# make sure that remote folder is not mounted
# no need to check output since we expect an error
umount /mnt/sheactive.co.uk/db

cd /home/activewms/data_transfers/netro_input
